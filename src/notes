notes

1. make a block allocator
  - blocks are always a power of 2


2. Defined a bump block

3. Define an allocator object trait
  - should be able to make an allocation header from the
    object

  - an allocator object should define the allocator header trait

  - Header should define...
      - object is marked?
      - object size
      - object is pointer? 
      - object pointer



Header:
  Array?
  u8
